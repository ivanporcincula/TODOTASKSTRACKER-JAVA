# TODOTASKSTRACKER-JAVA


As our country fully shifted to online classes, everyone has been adjusting with their time schedule, tasks to accomplish and anything related to online classes. Everyone needs something like a planner so they can keep track of the deadlines for each activity they need to accomplish. The program aims to help the students to keep track of the things that they need to accomplish at a specified time. With the use of IntelliJ and Java, the programmers were able to create a simple application of to-do tasks tracker with interactive user interface using the Graphics Console Program.  The implementation of Four pillars of OOP namely:  Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Abstraction were applied to the application and became a vital part of the classes in the program as these classes heavily relied on Polymorphism.
